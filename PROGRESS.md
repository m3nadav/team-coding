# team-coding Progress

## Status: Agentic Discussions

### 2026-03-22 — Host agent mode + /agentic-discussion

**Step 1 — Host `/agent-mode`:**

The host previously had `localClaude` only for moderation but no `/agent-mode` command. Now the host can pass `--with-claude` and use `/agent-mode` exactly like participants: a confirmation prompt is shown, local Claude auto-responds to participant chat messages, and the host can disable it with `/agent-mode off`.

Changes:
- `src/commands/host.ts` — Import `LocalClaude`; add `withClaude?: boolean` and `maxAgentHops?: number` to `HostOptions`; create `localClaude` if `--with-claude`; full agent mode state machine (`agentModeEnabled`, `isHostAgentTurn`, `agentResponseBuffer`, `lastAgentResponseTime`); `onAgentModeToggle` wired in `cmdCtx`; `server.on("chat")` handler auto-forwards to `localClaude` when agent mode is active and the message is not an agent response; on `turn_complete`, host broadcasts agent response via `server.broadcast({type: "chat_received", isAgentResponse: true, ...})`; `localClaude` cleanup on SIGINT and `/leave`
- `src/index.ts` — Added `--with-claude` and `--max-agent-hops <n>` options to `host` command

**Step 2 — `/agentic-discussion`:**

Two operating modes for agent-to-agent interaction:

| Mode | Loop prevention | When active |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Normal** | `isAgentResponse === true` blocks response | Default |
| **Discussion** | `agentHops` counter + `agent_chain_stop` event | During `/agentic-discussion` |

Flow:
1. Any participant (or host) types `/agentic-discussion 'topic'`
2. Server broadcasts `agent_discussion_start` to all — all clients set `discussionMode = true`
3. Agents auto-seed by responding to the topic at `agentHops = 1`
4. Each agent response carries `agentHops = incoming + 1`; agents respond to each other within the hop limit
5. **Host's Claude** acts as moderator: when it receives each agent message, it's prompted with "Continue or Stop?". On "STOP" (or when hops reach `--max-agent-hops`), an `agent_chain_stop` is broadcast
6. All clients clear `discussionMode`; agents go back to normal `isAgentResponse` blocking

Protocol changes (`src/protocol.ts`):
- Added `agentHops?: number` to `ChatMessage` and `ChatReceived`
- Added `maxAgentHops?: number` to `JoinAccepted`
- New client message: `AgenticDiscussionStart`
- New server messages: `AgentDiscussionStart`, `AgentChainStop`
- New type guards: `isAgenticDiscussionStart()`, `isAgentChainStop()`

Server changes (`src/server.ts`):
- Added `maxAgentHops` to `ServerOptions` (default 10); passed in `JoinAccepted`
- Preserves `agentHops` in `chat_received` broadcast
- Handles `agentic_discussion_start`: broadcasts `agent_discussion_start` to all
- Enforces hop ceiling: when `agentHops >= maxAgentHops`, broadcasts `agent_chain_stop` with `reason: "hop_limit"`

Client changes (`src/client.ts`):
- `sendChat(text, isAgentResponse?, agentHops?)` — passes `agentHops` in discussion mode
- `sendAgenticDiscussion(topic)` — sends `agentic_discussion_start`

Join changes (`src/commands/join.ts`):
- `discussionMode`, `currentIncomingHops`, `maxAgentHops` state
- Agent guard: normal = `!isAgent`; discussion = `!isAgent || msgHops < maxAgentHops`
- Outgoing hops: `client.sendChat(response, true, currentIncomingHops + 1)`
- `agent_discussion_start` handler: sets `discussionMode`, auto-seeds if agent mode is on
- `agent_chain_stop` handler: clears discussion state
- `onAgenticDiscussion` / `isDiscussionActive` wired in `cmdCtx`

Host changes (`src/commands/host.ts`):
- Discussion mode state: `discussionMode`, `discussionTopic`, `isModerating`, `moderationBuffer`, `firstDiscussionMessage`, `pendingModerationMessages`
- `processModerationMessage()`: sends moderation prompt to `localClaude` (initial turn includes system instructions + topic; subsequent turns ask "Continue or Stop?")
- `isModerating` flag suppresses localClaude output from UI; response collected in `moderationBuffer`
- On STOP verdict: broadcasts `agent_chain_stop`, clears discussion state
- On CONTINUE: processes next pending message or waits
- `agent_discussion_start` in `server_message` handler: detects when a participant starts a discussion
- `agent_chain_stop` in `server_message` handler: clears all discussion state
- `onAgenticDiscussion` / `isDiscussionActive` wired in `cmdCtx`

Session commands (`src/commands/session-commands.ts`):
- Added `onAgenticDiscussion` and `isDiscussionActive` to `CommandContext`
- `/agentic-discussion <topic>` and `/ad <topic>` alias
- Shows in `/help` when `onAgenticDiscussion` is wired

Tests: 520 pass (12 new — `/agentic-discussion` command tests, protocol type guard tests)

## Status: Post-Phase 7 Polish (continued)

### 2026-03-22 — Fix streaming output erased by typing indicators and system messages

**Root cause**: `clearInputLine()` always wrote `\r\x1b[2K` (carriage-return + erase line). `restoreInputLine()` always called `redrawLine()` which also starts with `\r\x1b[2K`. `showTypingIndicator()` and `clearTypingIndicator()` called `redrawLine()` directly. All of these erase the **current terminal line**.

While Claude is streaming, the cursor sits at the end of the last chunk — NOT on the input prompt line. So every event that triggered any of those functions during streaming (typing indicators from other participants, chat messages, system notices, participant join/leave) would erase whatever streaming text was on the current line. Responses would appear partial or completely blank depending on how many concurrent events arrived.

This explained why some participants saw full responses while others saw partial or nothing — it correlated directly with how active the session was (more activity → more line-erasing events → more content wiped).

**Changes** (`src/ui.ts`):
- `clearInputLine()`: when `claudeStreaming || localClaudeStreaming`, write `\n` (advance to new line without erasing) instead of `\r\x1b[2K`; this preserves streaming content while still giving system messages their own clean line
- `restoreInputLine()`: added `|| this.claudeStreaming || this.localClaudeStreaming` to the early-return guard; the input prompt is never redrawn while streaming output is in progress
- `showTypingIndicator()` and `clearTypingIndicator()`: added `!this.claudeStreaming && !this.localClaudeStreaming` guard before calling `redrawLine()` directly; previously bypassed the guards entirely

**Result**: Typing indicators, chat messages, system notices, and join/leave events no longer corrupt in-flight streaming output. Responses are fully visible regardless of session activity level.

### 2026-03-22 — Fix streaming inconsistency: mid-stream joiners, silent drops, WS crash

**Problems fixed**:

1. **Mid-stream join misses earlier chunks** — When a participant joins while Claude is streaming, they were immediately added to the broadcast registry but had no way to receive chunks already sent. This caused partial or empty responses for late joiners.

2. **Silent error swallowing in `handleWsMessage`** — The `try/catch` in `client.ts` wrapped both the decrypt step AND `this.emit("message", msg)`. If any listener (e.g. `ui.showStreamChunk`) threw an error, it was silently caught and the chunk was dropped entirely.

3. **Missing `ws.on("error")` handler in server** — An unhandled WebSocket "error" event with no listener becomes an uncaught exception → `process.exit(1)` → entire host session crashes for all participants.

4. **`showClaudeThinking()` not called for participant prompts** — Minor UX issue: the "Claude (thinking...)" indicator didn't show on the host UI when a participant (not the host) sent a `@claude` prompt.

**Changes**:
- `src/server.ts`:
  - Added `activeStreamBuffer: ServerMessage[]` — accumulates stream events from the current Claude turn
  - Added `bufferStreamEvent(msg)` — stores the event in the buffer AND broadcasts it; used by host.ts instead of `broadcast()` for `stream_chunk`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`
  - Added `clearStreamBuffer()` — called on `turn_complete` to reset the buffer
  - In `handleMessage()` join path: after sending `join_accepted`, replays the entire `activeStreamBuffer` to the new participant so they catch up on any in-progress response
  - Added `ws.on("error", () => {})` handler in `handleConnection()` — prevents WebSocket error events from becoming uncaught exceptions that crash the host process
- `src/client.ts`:
  - Refactored `handleWsMessage()` and `handleTransportMessage()` to only wrap the decrypt/parse step in `try/catch`; `this.emit("message", msg)` now runs outside the catch so listener errors propagate normally instead of silently dropping chunks
- `src/commands/host.ts`:
  - Replaced `server.broadcast()` with `server.bufferStreamEvent()` for `stream_chunk`, `tool_use`, `tool_result` events
  - On `turn_complete`: calls `server.clearStreamBuffer()` before `server.broadcast()` for the completion event
  - Added `ui.showClaudeThinking()` to the `server.on("prompt")` handler so participant-originated prompts show the thinking indicator on the host UI

**Result**: All participants now receive complete Claude responses regardless of when they joined the session. WebSocket errors no longer crash the host. Listener errors in message handlers are no longer silently swallowed.

### 2026-03-22 — Fix Cloudflare tunnel: wire wizard + auto-install binary

**Problem 1 — Wizard disconnected**: `runWizard()` in `wizard.ts` was never imported or called from `src/index.ts`. Running `team-coding` with no arguments showed Commander's default help text instead of the interactive wizard, making the Cloudflare tunnel option (and all other wizard-based connection types) completely unreachable.

**Problem 2 — Silent LAN fallback**: The old `startCloudflareTunnel()` spawned the system `cloudflared` binary. If that binary wasn't installed, `proc.on("error")` fired and the catch block silently fell back to a local LAN IP — printing a `ws://192.168.x.x:PORT` join command that is useless for remote participants.

**Changes**:
- `src/index.ts`:
  - Added `program.action()` as the default handler — when no subcommand is given, launches `runWizard()` and maps the result to `hostCommand`, `joinCommand`, or `startRelayServer`
  - Changed `program.parse()` → `program.parseAsync()` to correctly await the async default action
  - Fixed `lan`/`ssh` wizard connection types to pass `tunnel: "lan"` instead of incorrectly routing through `localtunnel`
- `src/commands/host.ts`:
  - Extended `HostOptions.tunnel` type to include `"lan"` so the wizard's LAN/SSH options start a local WS server without invoking any external tunnel provider
- `src/connection.ts`:
  - Replaced `spawn("cloudflared", ...)` with the [`cloudflared`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudflared) npm package (`Tunnel.quick()` API)
  - Binary is now auto-downloaded on first use — no manual install required
  - If auto-install fails, throws a clear error with fallback hint instead of silently showing a local IP
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json`: added `cloudflared` as a dependency

**Result**: `team-coding` (no args) now launches the wizard; picking "Cloudflare tunnel" correctly starts a `trycloudflare.com` tunnel and prints a `wss://` join command that works over the internet.


### 2026-03-21 — Fix session summary: cost, session ID, and SIGINT handler

- `src/commands/host.ts`:
  - Added `claudeSessionId` local var, captured on `session_init` event (more reliable than `getSessionId()` at exit time)
  - Added `totalCost` accumulator, incremented on each `turn_complete` event
  - All three exit paths (`onLeave`, SIGINT, and the second `onLeave` broadcast) now pass `cost` and `resumeSessionId` to `showSessionSummary`
  - Fixed SIGINT handler which was missed by a prior `replace_all` and still showed the bare summary
- `src/ui.ts` — `showSessionSummary` accepts optional `resumeSessionId`; when present, prints `claude --resume <id>` after the stats

### 2026-03-21 — Simplify participant local Claude — always fresh, no persistence

- Participants with `--with-claude` always start a fresh Claude process; it stays alive for the full join session and is reused for all `/think`, `/private`, and agent-mode prompts
- Removed `--continue` / `--resume` flags from `join` command (host-only)
- Removed `lastLocalSessionId` from config schema and all auto-resume logic from `join.ts`
- Stripped `continue`/`resume` from `LocalClaudeOptions`; simplified `session_init` message to "Local Claude ready." (fires only once, guarded by `!localSessionId`)
- Stored session ID per-project in `.team-claude.json` was also reverted — no persistence needed for participants
- `src/__tests__/local-claude.test.ts` updated to match simplified constructor

## Status: Post-Phase 7 Polish

### 2026-03-21 — /reply magic expansion + typing suppression for slash commands

- `src/ui.ts` — Added `onReplyExpansion(fn)` callback; in raw input handler, when space is pressed and buffer is exactly `/reply ` or `/r `, calls the callback and replaces the buffer with `@name ` (the last whisperer), cursor at end — so the user continues typing the message naturally
- `src/commands/join.ts` / `src/commands/host.ts`:
  - Wired `ui.onReplyExpansion(() => lastWhisperer ?? null)` after `startInputLoop()`
  - Added early-return in `onKeystroke` when input starts with `/` — calls `stopTyping()` so slash commands never broadcast a typing indicator to other participants
- 254 tests pass (unchanged)

## Status: Phase 7 Complete (/reply command)

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 7: /reply Command

- **Summary**:
  - `src/commands/join.ts` — Declared `lastWhisperer: string | undefined`; set it in `whisper_received` handler; wired `onReply` in `cmdCtx`: shows outgoing whisper and calls `client.sendWhisper([lastWhisperer], message)`
  - `src/commands/host.ts` — Same: declared `lastWhisperer`, set in `whisper_received` case of `server_message` listener, wired `onReply` in `cmdCtx` using `server.injectLocalMessage`
  - `src/__tests__/session-commands.test.ts` — Added 5 tests for `/reply`/`/r`: calls `onReply`, `/r` alias, no-message shows usage, no `onReply` shows "no whisper" message, `/help` shows `/reply`
  - 254 tests pass (5 new)
- **Next**: All planned phases complete

## Status: Phase 5 Complete + Polish

### 2026-03-21 — README rewrite

- Rewrote `README.md` to reflect all implemented phases; attribution reduced to a single line at the bottom before the license

### 2026-03-21 — System message formatting

- `src/ui.ts`: `showSystem()` now prefixes every message with `[system]` (no indentation) so system messages are visually distinct from chat
- `src/commands/host.ts`: Added `notice` handler in `server_message` listener — host now sees broadcast notices (agent mode toggles, context mode changes, etc.) that were previously silently dropped

### 2026-03-21 — Agent mode context + whisper reply

- `src/commands/join.ts`:
  - Shared Claude responses accumulate via `stream_chunk` and are added to `localChatHistory` as `"Claude: ..."` on `turn_complete`, so the agent's local Claude sees host Claude responses in context
  - `localContextStartIndex` tracks the context window start; resets after each Claude response (shared or local), matching the router's sliding-window behaviour
  - Agent auto-responds to incoming whispers with a whisper back to the sender (`agentTurnWhisperTarget`); group-chat messages still get `sendChat(…, true)`
  - All disable paths (manual, remote, error) clear `agentTurnWhisperTarget`
- 249 tests pass (unchanged)

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 5: Agent Mode

- **Summary**:
  - `src/client.ts` — Added `sendAgentModeToggle(enabled, participantId)`
  - `src/commands/session-commands.ts` — Added `onAgentModeToggle` and `isAgentMode` to `CommandContext`; `/agent-mode` now fully handled (was returning `false`); added to `/help` for `--with-claude` participants
  - `src/ui.ts` — Added `showConfirmation(message, onResult)`; extended `showUserPrompt` mode to `"chat"|"claude"|"agent"`; added `/agent-mode` autocomplete gated on `localClaudeActive`
  - `src/commands/join.ts` — Agent mode state machine: `agentModeEnabled`, `isAgentTurn`, `agentResponseBuffer`, `lastAgentResponseTime`; local Claude event handler buffers and broadcasts agent responses; `onAgentModeToggle` wired in `cmdCtx`; handles `agent_mode_toggle` from server for remote disable; rate limit (5 s) and loop prevention (`isAgentResponse`)
  - 249 tests pass (6 new for `/agent-mode`)

## Status: Post-Phase 4 Polish

### 2026-03-21 — Whisper display style

- **Summary**:
  - Updated `src/ui.ts` — Added `showWhisper(direction, user, targets, text, senderRole)`: incoming whispers render as `alice[whisper]:` in bold yellow/cyan (matching regular chat colors); outgoing as `you[whisper → alice]:` in dim (matching self-message style)
  - Updated `src/commands/join.ts` — Replaced `ui.showSystem("[whisper from/→ ...]")` calls with `ui.showWhisper()`
  - Updated `src/commands/host.ts` — Same replacement for outgoing; added `whisper_received` handling in `server_message` listener so the host now sees incoming whispers directed at them
  - 243 tests pass (unchanged)

### 2026-03-21 — Targeted typing indicators for whispers

- **Summary**:
  - Updated `src/protocol.ts` — Added `targets?: string[]` to `TypingMessage`
  - Updated `src/server.ts` — `routeMessage` for typing: sends `typing_indicator` only to named targets when `targets` is set; suppresses when `targets === []`; added `sendToByName(name, msg)` helper
  - Updated `src/client.ts` — `sendTyping(isTyping, targets?)` accepts optional targets
  - Updated `src/ui.ts` — Added `getCurrentInput()` returning current line buffer; backspace now fires `keystrokeHandler` so target resolution re-evaluates when `@name` is deleted
  - Updated `src/commands/session-commands.ts` — Exported `resolveTypingTargets(input, participantNames)`: returns `null` (broadcast), `[]` (suppress — `@` prefix but target unresolved), or `string[]` (targeted whisper)
  - Updated `src/commands/join.ts` and `src/commands/host.ts` — Replaced `isTyping` bool with `currentTyping: { targets } | null`; stop+restart when targets change mid-compose
  - 243 tests pass (8 new for `resolveTypingTargets`)

## Status: Phase 4 Complete

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 4: Private Local Claude Code

- **Phase**: Phase 4 (complete)
- **Summary**:
  - Created `src/local-claude.ts` — `LocalClaude` class wrapping `ClaudeBridge` with simplified API: `start()`, `sendPrompt(text)` (sends as "you" — no broadcast, purely local), `isBusy()`, `isStarted()`, `stop()`; re-emits all bridge events to its own `EventEmitter` listeners
  - Updated `src/index.ts` — Added `--with-claude` flag to `join` command
  - Updated `src/commands/join.ts` — Accepts `withClaude` option; spawns `LocalClaude` after connecting, wires its events to `ui.showLocalClaudeChunk`/`showLocalClaudeTurnComplete`/`showLocalClaudeError`; shows status on start; updates hint text; adds `onThink` to `cmdCtx` (checks `localClaude` at call time for safe async start failure handling); cleans up on `/leave`, disconnect, and SIGINT
  - Updated `src/commands/session-commands.ts` — Added `onThink?: (prompt: string) => void` to `CommandContext`; handles `/think <prompt>` and `/private <prompt>` commands (alias); shows "not available" message when `onThink` is not set (i.e., `--with-claude` not passed); `/help` dynamically shows `/think`/`/private` only when local Claude is available
  - Updated `src/ui.ts` — Added `showLocalClaudeChunk()` (streams with magenta `◆ your claude` header), `showLocalClaudeTurnComplete()`, `showLocalClaudeError()`, `showLocalClaudeStatus()` (shows `[local claude: active/stopped]`)
  - Created `src/__tests__/local-claude.test.ts` — 10 tests: ClaudeBridge construction, idempotent start, sendPrompt attribution, isBusy delegation, isStarted state, stop cleanup, event re-emission
  - Updated `src/__tests__/session-commands.test.ts` — Added 6 `/think`/`/private` tests: calls onThink, /private alias, no-prompt usage, missing local claude message, /help shows /think when active, /help hides when inactive
  - 224 total tests pass (17 new)
- **Next**: Phase 5 — Agent Mode (`/agent-mode`, auto-forward incoming chat to local Claude, rate limiting, loop prevention)

## Status: Phase 3 Complete

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 3: Shared Claude Integration

- **Phase**: Phase 3 (complete)
- **Summary**:
  - Updated `src/protocol.ts` — Added `contextMode?: "full" | "prompt-only"` field to `PromptMessage`
  - Rewrote `src/router.ts` — Added `ChatEntry`/`QueuedPrompt` interfaces; `addChatMessage()` for history tracking (bounded to 500); `buildContextPrefix()` that collects chat since last Claude response; `executeOrQueue()` that checks `claude.isBusy()` before sending — queues with notice if busy; `processQueue()` drained on every `turn_complete` event; `sendToClaudeWithContext()` prepends `[Team chat context]` block for `contextMode: "full"` or sends raw for `"prompt-only"`
  - Updated `src/server.ts` — In `routeMessage()`, sets `msg.contextMode = sender.contextMode` before emitting `"prompt"` so the router gets the participant's configured mode
  - Updated `src/commands/session-commands.ts` — Added `onContextModeChange` to `CommandContext`; added `/context-mode full|prompt-only` command with validation and help entry
  - Updated `src/client.ts` — Added `sendContextModeChange(mode)` method
  - Updated `src/commands/join.ts` — Wired `onContextModeChange` to `client.sendContextModeChange(mode)`
  - Updated `src/commands/host.ts` — Wired participant and host chat messages to `router.addChatMessage()`; added `onContextModeChange` that calls `server.injectLocalMessage` with `context_mode_change`
  - Updated `src/__tests__/router.test.ts` — Added 8 new tests: queuing when busy (notice broadcast), queue drain on `turn_complete`, FIFO queue order, `full` mode context inclusion, `prompt-only` mode raw pass-through, no context when no chat, old-chat exclusion after response
  - 207 total tests pass (8 new router tests, existing 199 all pass)
- **Next**: Phase 4 — Private Local Claude Code (`--with-claude` flag, `/think` command, local Claude per participant)

## Status: Phase 2 Complete (bug fixes applied)

### 2026-03-21 — Bug Fixes: --name heuristic and approval mode identity

- **Phase**: Post-Phase 2 bug fixes
- **Summary**:
  - `src/index.ts` (join command) — Removed `process.env.USER || "guest"` default from `--name` option so `options.name` is `undefined` when not passed. Name resolution is now `options.name ?? config.name ?? process.env.USER ?? "guest"`, fixing a bug where an explicitly passed name matching the system username was incorrectly treated as "not provided" and overridden by `config.name`.
  - `src/router.ts` — Changed `isHost` check from `msg.source === "host"` to `(msg.sender?.role ?? msg.source) === "host"`. `sender.role` is the server-validated identity set in `routeMessage()` for all participant messages; falls back to `source` for host-originated prompts (injected locally, no `sender`). Prevents any possibility of clients spoofing host identity via a crafted `source` field.
- **Next**: Phase 3 — Shared Claude Integration (multi-participant approval, conversation context, context-mode per participant)

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 2: Chat with Ordering & Whispers

- **Phase**: Phase 2 (complete)
- **Summary**:
  - Updated `src/commands/session-commands.ts` — Added `/who` command, `/kick <name>` with name arg, `/agent-mode off <name>` for host, `parseWhisper()` function (client-side `@name message` parsing, multi-target support, `@claude` exclusion), updated `CommandContext` (added `participantNames: () => string[]`, `onKick(name)`, `onAgentModeOff(name)`)
  - Updated `src/commands/host.ts` — Switched to `participantNames`, `onKick(name)`, `onAgentModeOff`, `participant_joined`/`participant_left` events with proper names
  - Updated `src/commands/join.ts` — Fixed `role: "participant"`, `participantNames`, `source === "participant"` echo suppression
  - Updated `src/client.ts` — Added `sendWhisper(targets, text)`, `sendChat(text, isAgentResponse?)`
  - Updated `src/ui.ts` — Role type supports `"host" | "guest" | "participant"`
  - Updated `src/__tests__/multi-participant.test.ts` — Added 1 new test: "routes whispers only to targeted participants"; fixed timing race in whisper test (register listeners before triggering join)
  - Updated `src/__tests__/session-commands.test.ts` — Added tests for `/who`, `/kick <name>`, `/agent-mode off`, `parseWhisper` (24 total session-command tests)
  - 200 total tests pass (11 multi-participant, 24 session-command)
- **Next**: Phase 3 — Shared Claude Integration (multi-participant approval, conversation context, context-mode per participant)

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 1: Multi-Participant Server

- **Phase**: Phase 1 (complete)
- **Summary**:
  - Created `src/participant.ts` — `ParticipantRegistry` class with add/remove, name uniqueness (case-insensitive), lookup by id/name/ws, host/remote filtering, `toInfoList()`/`toIdentity()`, event emission
  - Rewrote `src/protocol.ts` — Added `SenderInfo`, `ParticipantJoined`, `ParticipantLeft`, `WhisperMessage`, `WhisperReceived`, `AgentModeToggle`, `ContextModeChange`, `seq` field on all server messages, `participantId` + `participants[]` on `JoinAccepted`, replaced `"host"|"guest"` with `"host"|"participant"`, added type guards
  - Rewrote `src/server.ts` — Replaced single-guest model with `ParticipantRegistry`, multi-WebSocket fan-out with `broadcast()` and `sendTo()`, `injectLocalMessage()` for host, `maxParticipants` enforcement, `kickParticipant(name)`, `disableAgentMode(name)`, whisper routing, agent/context mode handling, transport participant support, monotonic `seq` counter
  - Updated all existing tests for "participant" source instead of "guest", new event names
  - Created `src/__tests__/participant.test.ts` (16 tests) and `src/__tests__/multi-participant.test.ts` (10 tests)
  - 188 total tests pass (26 new)
- **Next**: Phase 2 — Chat with ordering & whispers

### 2026-03-21 — Phase 0: Fork & Scaffold

- **Phase**: Phase 0 (complete)
- **Summary**:
  - Merged claude-duet codebase (from `https://github.com/EliranG/claude-duet`) into this repo via git remote + merge with unrelated histories
  - Rebranded all source files: `claude-duet` → `team-claude`, `ClaudeDuet*` → `TeamClaude*`
  - Updated `package.json`: name, version (0.1.0), description, bin entry, repo URLs, keywords
  - Updated `src/index.ts`: CLI name, description, version, added `--max-participants` flag
  - Updated `src/config.ts`: config paths use `team-claude` naming
  - Created `README.md` with clear attribution to claude-duet (EliranG), MIT license note, feature overview
  - Created `CLAUDE.md` with workflow rules (planning, testing, progress tracking, commits)
  - All 162 tests pass, build succeeds
- **Next**: Phase 1 — Multi-participant server (ParticipantRegistry, protocol extensions, server rewrite)

### 2026-03-21 — Initial Plan Created

- **Phase**: Pre-implementation (Planning)
- **Summary**: Explored claude-duet codebase, researched chat architecture patterns, designed 6-phase implementation plan (Phase 0-5).
- **Artifacts**: Plan file at `/Users/nadav/.claude/plans/steady-floating-moler.md`
